# 11-Note-Taker-App

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a program that will taking in a user's note (along with it's title) and save/store it into a database file where it can be accessed later. Once a user types in their note and it's title, the user has the option to save the note by clicking the 'save' icon that appears on the upper right hand corner of their screen. Saving their note will add a clickable row to the 'saved notes' section consisting of the title of their note. The user can, then, accessed their previously written note by clicking this button and the information will populate the main section. The user also has the option to delete any previously saved notes by clicking the red 'garbage' icon next to the clickable note row. This project was constructed with pre-written functions to read, write, & append to database files, along with methods to GET, POST, & DELETE user input data.

This application was deployed using Heroku.
